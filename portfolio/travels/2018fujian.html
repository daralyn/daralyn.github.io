	<h3>Travel Day(s)</h3> <h4>July 16-17, 2018</h4>
		<div class="travelupdatetext">
			<p>Today, we arrived at HNL around 8:00am, and were dropped off by my dad at the China Eastern Airlines check-in area. We got through security, and headed to the gate, which was a super long walk.
<br>Our flight was delayed about an hour, and once we boarded we left the gate pretty quickly, but had to wait in traffic control line for another hour. While waiting, my friend and I were looking at the safety card instructions, trying to read it all in Chinese. The flight was about 10 hours, and not too smooth (for me at least). 
<br>Since our layover in Shanghai was originally 2 hours, but we were delayed about 2 hours in Honolulu, we had about 30 mins as soon as we landed to get to our next flight, to Fuzhou. 
<br>Waiting for us on the ground as we exited our first plane were some crews to help those of us on the Hnolulu to Shanghai flight to connect to our flight to Fuzhou. We we ran from where we were, got through immigration, and through securityin time to get to our gate, which we then had 2 mins to spare because we had to be shuttled to the plane. 
<br>The flight to Fuzhou was about 2 hours. Once we landed, we found the checked bags, and headed outside to get picked up by the hotel airport van.
<br>We arrived at the hotel, checked in, and then walked around a little bit. We found a nice boardwalk area just a short walk away from the entrace to the hotel.
<br>We then ate dinner at the hotel around 8:00pm, and had a Fuzhou special: fish balls. It was delicious, and had some meat filling on the inside.

	<h3>Arrival (Day 1)</h3> <h4>July 18, 2018</h4>
		<div class="travelupdatetext">
			<p>Today we woke up, took some pictures and ate breakfast. Later, we went to the airport to wait for the rest of the group to show up. Some people were delayed, so we went to lunch at a nearby restaurant, before heading back to the airport to pick them up. 
<br>In the afternoon, we took a 3-3.5 hour bus ride to Wuyi Mountain, where we would be staying. 
<br>That evening, we had a welcome dinner. After the dinner, we met in the conference room, and were introduced to some faculty that had helped set up the camp and would be teaching us. 
<br>We played some games, and also, group leaders were chosen so that small groups would also look out for each other. With 33 campers, leadership and organization is super important. I was chosen to be one of the leaders, and was a bit stressed out about it first, because I couldn’t understand all about what was being said about my responsibilities. </p>

	<h3>Day 2</h3> <h4>July 19, 2018</h4>
		<div class="travelupdatetext">
			<p>Today we had to be up pretty early because we would be going to the 武夷山学院 (Wuyi Mountain school). There, we had a welcome and opening ceremony where we learned all about the special things in the area. 
<br>The school that we went to had a really nice campus, and it was also really big. One of the teachers said it would take 40 minutes to walk from the south end to the north end of the campus. 
<br>After the opening ceremony, we went on a small tour of the campus, but it was extremely hot, so we did half the tour on the air conditioned bus. 
<br>Once we finished, we went back to our hotel for lunch, and to take a break. After that, we went back to the school and took a class about 朱子 (Zhuzi), a famous Chinese philosopher in the southern parts of China. He was born in 1130 in the FuJian province, and interpreted many of Confucius’ works. 
<br>After this class, we went back to the hotel for dinner, and new groups were assigned. 
<br>After dinner, some of us wanted to go out to the market, and see a little bit of what was around the area. The market was about 2 blocks down from the hotel, and sold lots of snacks, drinks, and other conveniences. I bought a big 5L jug of water to bring back to the hotel. </p>

	<h3>Day 3</h3> <h4>July 20, 2018</h4>
		<div class="travelupdatetext">
			<p>Today we woke up and ate breakfast, and had some time to spend on our own before class started. Lorraine and I went to explore the hotel grounds, trying to find the ping pong and pool table. 
Then we went up to a conference room in our hotel, and we learned a little more about Zhuzi and some stories if his childhood. 
<br>They also gave us som lotus seeds to try. That was the first time I’d tried one, and it was quite good. 
After lunch, we had another break until 3. 
<br>We met in the same conference room again, and had music class. We sang 朱子家训(zhuzi jiaxun), and 茉莉花. 
After this, we had a short break before eating dinner. 
<br>After dinner, when we went back to the room, we saw that the sun was setting, so we went outside to take pictures. While we were outside, there were a lot of bats flying around. It was really amazing. </p>
