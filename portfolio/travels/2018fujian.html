	<h3>Travel Day(s)</h3> <h4>July 16-17, 2018</h4>
		<div class="travelupdatetext">
			<p>Today, we arrived at HNL around 8:00am, and were dropped off by my dad at the China Eastern Airlines check-in area. We got through security, and headed to the gate, which was a super long walk.
<br>Our flight was delayed about an hour, and once we boarded we left the gate pretty quickly, but had to wait in traffic control line for another hour. While waiting, my friend and I were looking at the safety card instructions, trying to read it all in Chinese. The flight was about 10 hours, and not too smooth (for me at least). 
<br>Since our layover in Shanghai was originally 2 hours, but we were delayed about 2 hours in Honolulu, we had about 30 mins as soon as we landed to get to our next flight, to Fuzhou. 
<br>Waiting for us on the ground as we exited our first plane were some crews to help those of us on the Hnolulu to Shanghai flight to connect to our flight to Fuzhou. We we ran from where we were, got through immigration, and through securityin time to get to our gate, which we then had 2 mins to spare because we had to be shuttled to the plane. 
<br>The flight to Fuzhou was about 2 hours. Once we landed, we found the checked bags, and headed outside to get picked up by the hotel airport van.
<br>We arrived at the hotel, checked in, and then walked around a little bit. We found a nice boardwalk area just a short walk away from the entrace to the hotel.
<br>We then ate dinner at the hotel around 8:00pm, and had a Fuzhou special: fish balls. It was delicious, and had some meat filling on the inside.

	<h3>Arrival (Day 1)</h3> <h4>July 18, 2018</h4>
		<div class="travelupdatetext">
			<p>Today we woke up, took some pictures and ate breakfast. Later, we went to the airport to wait for the rest of the group to show up. Some people were delayed, so we went to lunch at a nearby restaurant, before heading back to the airport to pick them up. 
<br>In the afternoon, we took a 3-3.5 hour bus ride to Wuyi Mountain, where we would be staying. 
<br>That evening, we had a welcome dinner. After the dinner, we met in the conference room, and were introduced to some faculty that had helped set up the camp and would be teaching us. 
<br>We played some games, and also, group leaders were chosen so that small groups would also look out for each other. With 33 campers, leadership and organization is super important. I was chosen to be one of the leaders, and was a bit stressed out about it first, because I couldn’t understand all about what was being said about my responsibilities. </p>

	<h3>Day 2</h3> <h4>July 19, 2018</h4>
		<div class="travelupdatetext">
			<p>Today we had to be up pretty early because we would be going to the 武夷山学院 (Wuyi Mountain school). There, we had a welcome and opening ceremony where we learned all about the special things in the area. 
<br>The school that we went to had a really nice campus, and it was also really big. One of the teachers said it would take 40 minutes to walk from the south end to the north end of the campus. 
<br>After the opening ceremony, we went on a small tour of the campus, but it was extremely hot, so we did half the tour on the air conditioned bus. 
<br>Once we finished, we went back to our hotel for lunch, and to take a break. After that, we went back to the school and took a class about 朱子 (Zhuzi), a famous Chinese philosopher in the southern parts of China. He was born in 1130 in the FuJian province, and interpreted many of Confucius’ works. 
<br>After this class, we went back to the hotel for dinner, and new groups were assigned. 
<br>After dinner, some of us wanted to go out to the market, and see a little bit of what was around the area. The market was about 2 blocks down from the hotel, and sold lots of snacks, drinks, and other conveniences. I bought a big 5L jug of water to bring back to the hotel. </p>

	<h3>Day 3</h3> <h4>July 20, 2018</h4>
		<div class="travelupdatetext">
			<p>Today we woke up and ate breakfast, and had some time to spend on our own before class started. Lorraine and I went to explore the hotel grounds, trying to find the ping pong and pool table. 
Then we went up to a conference room in our hotel, and we learned a little more about Zhuzi and some stories if his childhood. 
<br>They also gave us som lotus seeds to try. That was the first time I’d tried one, and it was quite good. 
After lunch, we had another break until 3. 
<br>We met in the same conference room again, and had music class. We sang 朱子家训(zhuzi jiaxun), and 茉莉花. 
After this, we had a short break before eating dinner. 
<br>After dinner, when we went back to the room, we saw that the sun was setting, so we went outside to take pictures. While we were outside, there were a lot of bats flying around. It was really amazing. </p>

	<h3>Day 4</h3> <h4>July 21, 2018</h4>
		<div class="travelupdatetext">
			<p>Today, we woke up and had to get ready by 8:10 and met in the classroom. 
<br>Some teachers came in and gave us a lesson about paper cutting. I learned that the northern and southern parts of China have different styles of cutting paper. One of the teachers said that if you can think of something or see anything, you can make a picture of it out of paper. I thought that was really interesting and could be a big challenge and needs creativity. 
<br>We didn’t do paper cutting, but we cut some felt and some Chinese characters, into a pillow-like object. We also learned how to make tassels with the felt. 
<br>After we finished this session, we went to go eat lunch, and take a rest. Our next activity didn’t start until 4:30pm, so we took naps and hung out until our next class. 
In the afternoon, we made dumplings, and also watched a chef carve vegetables into a bird sculpture. 
<br>For dinner, we ate the dumplings, as well as other foods that were brought out. </p>

	<h3>Day 5</h3> <h4>July 22, 2018</h4>
		<div class="travelupdatetext">
			<p>Today we had a lesson in the morning about the tea ceremony in Wuyishan. We learned how a tea ceremony starts, and about the different types of leaves. We tasted teas, and made some ourselves. 
<br>After lunch, we had a opera lesson (京剧), and learned how to dance and sing a little bit. It was pretty difficult, but an interesting experience. One of the teachers used to be a famous opera actor, so it was pretty cool to have her perform in front of us. They sang in the zhejiang province language, so it was a bit harder for us to sing than if it had been sung in mandarin.  <br>after dinner, we went to the 大红袍 Show. It was about tea. The special thing about this is that the seats you sit is on a platform that rotates. So as the scene changes, we get rotated. It was about 70mins, and quite unique. However, I didn’t really enjoy it as much because I got motion sick. </p>		</div>

	<h3>Day 6</h3> <h4>July 23, 2018</h4>
		<div class="travelupdatetext">
			<p>This morning, we had to get up at 6:30am. We then drove to the place where we would take a bamboo raft down the river. The scenery was amazing! Last night, however, it rained, so all the dirt and silt was washed into the water. Usually the river is super clear. The ride was about two hours, and each boat had 6 passengers on it, and two people moving the boat. They used long bamboo poles and a pointy metal tip to move the boat, but pushing the tip of the stick at the bottom of the river. 
<br>After we got off the rafts, we went to see a bat cave. It was pretty stinky inside, and some of the passageways were super skinny and vertical. Since there were lots of people in there, it was also not as enjoyable as it might have been, if there was more time. 
<br>We came back to the hotel around 11:30 and ate lunch. Our next activity, was hiking, which we met in the lobby at 2:30 for. 
<br>We went to Tianyou peak mountain. The hike had a lot of stairs, but the view was incredible. We were all exhausted when we came back down. 
<br>After we got back to the hotel, we ate dinner, and then had so send a recording of us singing to our teacher because we have a performance at the end of camp. </p>

	<h3>Day 7</h3> <h4>July 24, 2018</h4>
		<div class="travelupdatetext">
			<p>This morning, after eating breakfast, we went to the HuXiao Cliff. We had to meet at the Tiancheng temple. There were two paths to take: one was up the mountain, and the other was not so rigorous. I took the easier path because I didn’t want to push myself too hard today. 
<br>In the afternoon, we went to look at the original trees for Dahongpao tea. There were 6 trees which were all about 400 years old. These trees are no longer used though, because the tree produces more leaves, and that makes the leaves more bitter. The way they plant more is by taking a stem, and planting it in the ground. 
<br>After we looked at the trees, we went to a tea factory, and had a tea ceremony. We tried local teas, and they also gave us mushroom soup-tea thing, which was supposed to help ease ones temper. They also had some snake alcohol, which we applied to help relax the muscles and make the blood flow. At first, I didn’t feel anything, then it started to feel really cold, and then I’d started burning. I’m not sure if it helped, but it was definitely surprising. 
<br>After the tea ceremony, we went back to the hotel for dinner. </p>

	<h3>Day 8</h3> <h4>July 25, 2018</h4>
		<div class="travelupdatetext">
			<p>This morning, we got up and ate breakfast, before heading out in 3 seperate busses, because the big bus couldn’t take us on the small winding roads. On one of the busses, was the highest government official in the Wuyishan area. He came around with us the whole day. 
<br>Our bus ride was about 1.5 hours. When we got to the destination, we hiked up the mountain a little ways to get to a waterfall. It was really pretty, and the water was super clear and clean. 
<br>We hung out up there for a while to take photos. Afterwards, we get back into the busses to get to lunch. Today, we didn’t eat lunch at the hotel. 
<br>After lunch, we drove to a place where we could swim in the water. It was really refreshing, and sort of fun. However, for safety reasons, we had to wear life jackets the whole time, which was understandable, but slightly annoying. 
<br>At the swimming place, there were also monkeys nearby. So after changing, we went to go take pictures of the monkeys. Some of the monkeys looked really scared, but there were also super cute baby monkeys too. 
<br>After we finished taking pictures, we got back into the bus, and headed back to the hotel for dinner. </p>

	<h3>Day 9</h3> <h4>July 26, 2018</h4>
		<div class="travelupdatetext">
			<p>Today we woke up pretty early so we could go to Wufu, where Zhuzi once lived. We did a ceremony inside the most famous school building in the area. It was about 800 years old. 
<br>The ceremony consisted of students showing their respect to teachers and elders, to gain acceptance into the school/to be the teacher’s student. 
<br>We then walked down some alleys, and passed the place where Zhuzi’s house was. We also saw Zhuzi’s statue from a distance.
<br>After that, we took a short break to eat ice cream. Then we walked over to a restaurant to eat lunch. We also took pictures of lotus flowers, which was on the way to the restaurant. 
<br>When we finished lunch, we got back on the bus to drive back to the hotel. 
<br>We had the whole afternoon to ourselves. Some people went shopping, and others did activities inside. Lorraine and I wanted to learn wushu, so we spent some of the afternoon watching a video of what we would be learning tomorrow. </p>

	<h3>Day 10</h3> <h4>July 27, 2018</h4>
		<div class="travelupdatetext">
			<p>This morning, we took a bus ride to jianyang city to see black China. Jianyang is knoen for two things: lots of grapes and black China. Black China originated in the Song Dynasty, which was about 1000 years ago. 
<br>While we were there, they gave us tea, and also let us see their workshop area. They allowed a few students to try to do wheel throwing. I’ve always wanted to try pottery, so I tried when we had a chance. It was really fun, and a little easier than I expected because I’ve heard so many people say how hard it was. 
<br>After this, we went to a school nearby to learn more about tea culture in the area, more on the black China, and also to eat lunch.  Lunch was really fancy and delicious. They had a lot of fruit as part of their meal. We also had local specialties. The food was so good it was like we were in a dream! Then they also gave us each our own black China pottery cups/bowls. 
<br> We took a short break after lunch, and then headed over to the Wushu school. The while afternoon we spent watching and learning Wushu. We also took some pictures with the kids there. The Wushu we learned today we have to perform on the closing night.
<br>When we got back, we ate dinner and went back to our rooms. My legs were sore from doing all the Wushu poses, so I stretched too. </p>
