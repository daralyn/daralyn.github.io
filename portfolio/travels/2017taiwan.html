  2017 G-term Taste of Taiwan Trip
</h1>

<p>Punahou has started a "class" called G-term, where students have the opportunity to learn new things outside of the normal classroom setting, including travel experiences. In my sophomore year, I had the opportunity to travel to Taiwan for G-term. Below are parts of my experience while I was on this trip.</p>

<div class="sectionodd">
	<h3>January 3, 2017</h3> <h4>summary</h4>
		<div class="taiwantext">
			<p>After getting off the 10 hour plane ride, we got our luggage and exchanged money. Immediately we found our tour guide, Ivy, who had been up all night waiting for our flight, which landed earlier than expected. We left the airport around 5:55 and took the tour bus to Little Oil Pit. On the way, Ivy gave us some beautiful postcards and a booklet of useful sayings. 
<br>Little Oil Pit was at the top of a mountain, and it was quite cold and misty. As we walked along the path it started to rain. We were able to see some of the sulfur hot springs (which stunk pretty badly) but it was too rainy so we couldn't see the view. We got caught in heavy rain and waited under a nearby shelter (which was still closed, probably because it was too early in the morning). It really woke us up though, a pretty fun start of the trip. Then we left and went down the mountain to 7 Eleven, where Ivy told us to buy a rain poncho so we can use it for the rest of the trip. Many of us also bought a few snacks and food for the bus ride. 
<br>Then we went to Yang Ming Shan National Park. At the park, it was still raining so we wore our ponchos and took out our umbrellas. We walked through the forest and saw lots of different plants including plum blossom trees, which were fragrant and blooming, cherry blossom trees, maple trees, ferns, taro, and many more. Then we stopped off at their gift shop, which was just opening as we arrived. There we had a "Taste of Taiwan", which was a throat soothing medicine/candy and ginger tea. On our way to the bus, we also saw the big clock. 
<br>Then we went to the National Palace Museum, where Ivy took us around and showed us a few Chinese antiques including brass pieces, jade, and porcelain. One of the brass pieces, Mao Gong Ding, had writings carved inside the bowl. One of the most famous jade pieces we saw was the Jade Cabbage. Then we had lunch at a nearby restaurant. 
<br>After lunch we were supposed to go to Fort San Domingo, however, they were closed because Monday was a National Holiday but on Mondays they don't open, so they took another day off. So instead, we went to the Oxford College, where we learned a little bit about Dr Mackay, and also took a nice break by a pond. Then we started to walk down to the river to Tamsui old street. By before going there, we stopped by Dr Mackay's old dentistry place, were we were served tea and they shared with us his story. He had come to Taiwan from Canada as a Presbyterian pastor, but many of the locals were afraid of him and didn't listen to him. Then he started helping people out with their teeth and won the respect of the people, who would then listened to him, and he continued to help the people. He also valued women's education so he built a school for them. In addition to this, he established over 60 churches in Taiwan and two hospitals. 
<br>At Tamsui Old Street, we were given and hour and a half of free time. Many of us tried some bubble tea and shopped for snacks, souvenirs and took lots of pictures. We all met at a Starbucks at the end of the street and went to dinner at the Five Dime Restaurant. The architecture was fascinating, and it felt like a maze in there. Then we finally arrived at the hotel, all of us were ready to crash.</p>

			<p>Had a good nights sleep last night and a wake up call at 6:20am. We went down to breakfast and left the hotel at 8:00 and walked to the nearby station: 行天宮. We went to the Chiang Kai-shek memorial which didn't open until 9, so we walked around the area for a while. The memorial took 6 years to build and was finished in 1981. Chiang Kai-shek is not buried there, but in the country side, and this is just a statue of him. We had the chance to watch the changing of the guards which happens hourly. The area used to be occupied by the military, by is now a citizen center. Every evening the performing arts shows are sold out. During the day many different activities go on such as Tai-chi matching band practice, street dance practice, etc. 
<br>Then we rode one more stop on the MRT to the university. For cultural and language learning. First we split up into two groups: beginners and advanced. The beginner group practiced a dialogue, went over bargaining, played bingo. The advanced group went over a shopping lesson talking about cheap vs expensive. Then we had lunch at a cafe on campus. After lunch we had a cultural experience where we made stamps which we printed on bags. We traced pictures of roosters (Chinese new year is going to be year of the rooster) and carved them onto a special board, painted it and stamped it. Because this took a long time, we were unable to visit the Sun Yat-sen memorial, so we went straight to Taipei 101. 
<br>Taipei 101 started its service in 2003 and has a total of 64 elevators. It also had the worlds fastest elevators which travel 89 floors in 37 seconds. Taipei 101 also has 7 wind dampers, which are used to counteract strong winds, and only one is open for public viewing. We also went to the open air level (floor 91) and got better pictures of the skyline, moon, and city lights.
<br>Afterwards we went downstairs to Din Tai Fung, where we had a variety of different dumplings, and of course, the Xiao Long Bao. The line was very long, but the food was delicious. 
<br>Then we took the MRT on the red line to 東門 then on the yellow line to 行天宫, back to the hotel.</p>

			<p>Started out the day with a small breakfast because a number of us were still full from the Din Tai Fung dinner. Four students went to the nearby convenience store to look for snacks. We left the hotel shortly after 8:30 and got on our tour bus to shifen to make wishes, write them in a lantern, and release it into the air. One question we had was what happens to the lanterns after they come back down. We found out that the locals pick then up and turn them into the government and can get 30 TWD back for each one. 
<br>Then we took a short drive to the entrance of the waterfall, and walked down to get a good look at it. There are lots of waterfalls in Taiwan, but what makes this one so special is how wide and tall it is. Most other waterfalls are much smaller and trickle in between the rocks, which we may see in Hualian. 
<br>Next we went to Jiufen old street. Jiufen used to be an old mountain mining town. At Jiufen old street we walked around and got our own lunches. A number of us tried fried stinky tofu, I'd say it tasted much better than it smelled. 
<br>Then we went to a temple, built in 1767, and is sometimes called the temple of the art. We learned that you enter through the dragon door and exit through the tiger door. 
<br>Afterwards we had a little time to go to the ceramics museum, where we were able to see all these cool uses or ceramics, like circuit boards, ultra sounds, grinding stones, etc. 
<br>The museum closed at 5pm and dinner started at 6, so we had some time to walk around on a ceramics old street, which was also the street where the restaurant we ate dinner at was. The restaurant was called Fugui, which is a fusion between Asian and Western cuisine. We were able to choose our main course: ribs, pork, chicken, shrimp, or vegetarian.
<br>Tomorrow we will have an early start where we will leave Taipei to go to Hualien.</p>

			<p>Had a wake up call around 4:30am which we immediately shut off, but then realized we needed to get up to get to the lobby at 5:30 to check out to catch the train to Hualien. When leaving the hotel, we grabbed box breakfast which were two half sandwiches, a banana, cookies and oolong tea. 
<br>The train ride was 2 hours long, and we went southward along the east side Taiwan. We passed by tall mountains in the right and the Pacific Ocean to the left. When we arrived in Hualien it was around 8:30am. We walked out of the train station and found our bus, which we then rode to Taroko Gorge. The part if Taroko Gorge we went through was called Swallow Grotto. We were required to wear helmets because danger of falling rocks. The rocks are about 7.5 hardness and are marble, and we learned the color of the marble is because of the different metals in the rock. 
<br>Then we went to eat a beef noodle lunch. In this area, there are lots of retired soldiers that don't know what to do. Some have gone to work on highways, established families, go to the mountains to grow vegetables, and some others have decided to make beef noodles, which is where we went. 
<br>As a dessert, our tour guide treated us to fresh mochi, which was a short drive away. Then we began our long bus drive down to Taitung. The bus drive was between two of the five mountain ranges that make up Taiwan. Along the way we stopped off and got ice cream, and we also took a short break at the Tropic of Cancer. I learned that if you hold something right on the Tropic of Cancer, there won't be a shadow. 
<br>After the long scenic drive through the mountains, we finally arrived at the hotel. We all ate a quick dinner and then most of us changed to go to the hot springs, where we stayed until it pretty much closed.</p>

			<p>Because of the late night, we skipped going to the southern most point of Taiwan. Instead, we cut through the central mountains to get to the western side of Taiwan. The first part of the drive was along the Pacific Coast. The water was calm and pretty shades of blue. Along the way we stopped off at a fruit store where we sampled a pieces of fresh fruits and dried fruits. Then we arrived at a Hakka village where we ate a Hakka lunch. And made some Lei cha, a local Hakka activity. Lei cha is made of 4 main ingredients: white/black sesame, peanuts, red bean, and pop rice. We used a guava stick to grind the ingredients in the bowl. 
<br>Then we went to Tainan, which was the old capital of Taiwan before it got moved to Taipei. 
<br>Before dinner, we went to Provintia, which is an old fort built by the Dutch, which was partially destroyed, and then the Chinese rebuilt it with Chinese architecture later on. Then we had dinner and arrived at the hotel, where we dropped off our luggage, and then most of us went outside to shop and get bubble tea.</p>

	<h3>January 8, 2017</h3> <h4>location</h4>
		<div class="taiwantext">
			<p>We started off our last day in Taiwan by going to the first school in Taiwan: the Confucius temple(夫子庙). It was established in 1687 by Emperor Kangxi. The school was not just for worship only, there was also a temple, which were separated by a wall. The school is on the right, and the temple on the left. Confucius was born in 500BC, around the time of Aristotle and Plato, and is considered the teacher of all teachers. Most Chinese people consider him a divine being and come to the temple to worship him. 
<br>Next we went to Anping fort, which was built by the Dutch around 1620. The bricks were similar to the bricks at Provintia, skinny and wide. The reason we don't use these bricks to built anymore is because they're too hard to hold in one hand. The mortar was made of sticky rice, oysters, and brown rice. 
<br>Just outside the Anping fort was an old street. The old street consisted of many shops, some of which sold shrimp chips, snacks, and souvenirs. Then we walked over to the Anping Tree House. It was originally a warehouse with a banyan tree next to it. Today the banyan tree has invaded the building. The building has been renovated with wooden pads and steel structures for bird watching. 
<br>Then we went to lunch at Chou's Shrimp rolls, where we enjoyed our last lunch in Taiwan together. 
<br>After lunch we went to take a quick stop at the beach, which was actually along the Taiwan straight. We spent half an hour there walking around, looking at shells, and taking pictures. Then we went to the train station, and took the high speed rail up to Taoyuan. The average speed of the high speed rail is 287 km per hour, and the max speed is 310 km per hour. Then we got on our tourbus and went to our last dinner at a hotel nearby the airport. On the way, some of us shared words about what we learned and how much fun we had. After dinner we gave our tour guide and bus driver cards and lei, and were off to the airport. We will all miss Taiwan a lot!</p>
