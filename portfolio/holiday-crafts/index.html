<h2> Thanksgiving 2017 </h2>
    <div class="crafttext">
			 <p>This year I made a "Thanksgiving Tree". The branches were made from wire, which I twisted and bent to create the shape of the tree. The base was made of cardboard, and covered with paper, which I painted red, orange, and yellow colors. Then I cut out leaves to with twine to hang on the branches. When we had guests over, we had them write what they were thankful for on some leaves, and to hang on the tree.</p>

<h2>Thanksgiving 2016</h2>
  <div class="crafttext">
			 <p>This craft is made from construction paper and ribbons. I cut out orange construction paper in the shape of a pumpkin folded in half vertically. Then the pieces were glued together, rolled up brown construction paper placed in the middle, and green ribbons tied to the stem.</p>
