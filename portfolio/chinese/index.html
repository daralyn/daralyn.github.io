<h1>About My Chinese Journey</h1>
<p> 我姐姐五岁的时候爸爸妈妈让她开始上中文学校。那时候我才三岁，可是也跟姐姐一起上中文学校。那时我们住在波士顿，上Cambridge Ellis学校的中文课。每个星期六也去列克星敦上另一个中文学校，学了注音符号。我五岁的时候，我家人搬到夏威夷 。在这儿，爸爸找了几个中文学校。我们先上了夏威夷慈济人文学校，但是我们觉得每次都看太多电视，所以我们上了另外一个中文学校：檀香山华人信议会的中文学校。可是上那个学校不但时间不方便，而且我也没有朋友。爸爸继续找，终于找到了夏威夷中文学校。我们从2007年到2013年一直都在那儿学中文。
<br>虽然我姐姐的中文比我的更好，可是我一直跟我姐姐上一样的班。 我们有考试的时候，她每次都得满分，我每次都想哭。这时候我非常讨厌中文，不想学习。此外，姐姐也说学中文不太难，我就以为我的中文非常糟糕。在2011年我们跟夏威夷中文学校一起去中国旅游，参观了一个学校。我们的老师叫我们在这个学校做自我介绍，不过我一句话都没说因为没有自信说中文。在普纳荷学校七年级每个学生都需要选一个外语，我选了中文课因为我想从头再来学一下。上了这门课以后我才发现我的中文其实很不错，也有很多机会帮我的同学们。2015年有机会跟普纳荷学校再去中国旅游。这次我有很多机会练习我的中文，觉得很好玩。现在中文课是我最喜欢的课目之一。我感觉学中文最有意思的事是学以致用。比如到中国用我在学校所学的汉语与当地人进行交流对我来说真有意义。</p>
<p> When I was three years-old, my parents sent my older sister and me to Chinese school. At that time, I was living in Boston, and we went to Cambridge Ellis School during the summer. On weekends, we would drive to Lexington to attened a different Chinese school. When I was five, our family moved to Hawaii, and my dad looked around for Chinese schools to send us to. He finally found one called Hawaii Chinese Immersion School (HCIS), and we went there from 2007-2013. 
<br> Although my older sister's Chinese was much better than mine, I was always put in the same class level as her. As a result, when we had tests, I would always do more poorly that her on them, and would come home crying. I hated Chinese at that time, and didn't want to learn Chinese anymore. Furthermore, it hurt when my older sister said she liked Chinese and that it was fun and kind of easy for her. It made me feel like I was terrible at Chinese. 
  <br> In middle school, at Punahou, we are able to choose a foreign language to learn. I thought that I might as well start learning Chinese from scratch, so I took it in 7th grade. It was then that I realized my Chinese was not that bad. I was able to help my classmates out, and it encouraged me in my Chinese studies. In 8th grade, over spring break in 2015, I was able to go with our school to visit China and our sister school, in Shanghai. Going there really helped me appreicate all that I had learned in the classroom, because it allowed me to go into the real world and speak to Chinese people in their language.
<br> I countinued taking Chinese in high school, jumping to Chinese 3 Honors as a freshman, and finishing with the highest level my school offers, Chinese 5 Honors as a junior. My favorite part about learning Chinese is being able to apply it in real life to Chinese people I meet here in Hawaii to speaking to local Chinese people in China. This journey has definately had lots of bumps in the road, but I have grown from it and also have a better appreciation for both the culture and the language.
