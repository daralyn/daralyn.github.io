<div>
<p> This year, my senior year in high school, I'm taking a class called Elements of Design. In this class, we learn about design technique and have projects working on different aspects of design. After finishing each project, we each of us must present it in front of the class, take critiques and comments from peers. When others are presenting, we are expected to give feedback to help those who are presenting. After everyone has presented, we vote on which ones we felt were best, and whoever wins the votes gets a blue ribbon. 
<br>Here is a collection of some of the projects I did for the class so far.

	<h3>Word Project</h3> <h4>September 6, 2018</h4>
		<div class="assignmentdescription">
			<p>This was our very first project, and sort of an introduction to Adobe Illustrator. We had to design a word that illustrates its own meaning.
			<br> I chose to illustrate the word "galaxy" because during the time of the project, we had read an article in physics class about galaxies and I thought it was a pretty cool word. From presenting and seeing other designs, I learned that I could have integrated the letters a bit more to the picture itself.

	<h3>Playing Cards</h3> <h4>September 14, 2018</h4>
		<div class="assignmentdescription">
			<p>The assignment: Design a deck of cards. The deck must consist of the King of Hearts, Queen of Diamonds, 9 of Clubs and the back of one card. All cards should be the same size and be designed like a normal playing card (upside down and right side up, face and number in upper left and bottom right, etc...). Choose a theme (for example "Geometric", "Shapes", "Sports") and make all the cards had to match the theme. Design your own symbols that are similar to the standard symbols but match your theme. You are not allowed to use use standard card symbols.
		<br> For this project, I chose to do a "Chinese" theme because I thought I could keep the colors red and black. For the king and queen, I used the character in Chinese that meant king and queen respectively. To differentiate diamonds from hearts, I used different charaters on the "inside"/filling of the big word and also made the hearts have white characters with red backgrounds. For the nine of clubs, I used nine of the "club" symbols, which were black circles with the character that meant "clubs" in Chinese. As for the symbols, I used the characters that meant what each of the suits were, and shaped the character into the general shape of it's original symbol. The back of the card I made bamboo with a calligraphy brush on paper, took a picture, and put it into illustrator.

	<h3>Business Card</h3> <h4>October 11, 2018</h4>
		<div class="assignmentdescription">
			<p>Assignment: Design a logo and business card for your a company of your choice. Do 2 pages of design ideas and get approval before you start the final draft. The card must include the logo, all pertinent information for the company (A business card is 2"x3.5" so your card will be proportional.)
		<br> I chose my client to be the pastor at my church. I started off by interviewing him about what kind of image did he want this organization to portray, the target audience, information to include, colors, etc. He said he would like blues since we live in Hawaii and it is the color of the ocean. I designed the logo on Illustrator. I couldn't find the right brushstroke for my original idea, and then I accidentally found this pattern and thought it worked better than my first idea. I wanted to keep the logo close to the original design, which was a globe with two brown bands wrapping around it to make a cross on the middle-left hand side. The writing that is on the back side is the vision statement.
		<br> Because the target audience was international students, I decided to make the text really simple and easy to read. The simplicity of the text I chose also made the card look more professional. I put symbols next to the website, email, and facebook pages because these symbols are universal, and people could easily recognize them. 
		<br> I tied for the blue ribbon on this project!

	<h3>Poster Project</h3> <h4>October 23, 2018</h4>
		<div class="assignmentdescription">
			<p>The assignment: Design a poster for a teacher on campus, something they can use for instruction in class or a poster for a club or a school event. You must interview the teacher or club representative to gather your information. You must get approval of your rough draft from your client.
		<br> I chose make my poster for the bible study club that my friends and I started. I talked to them about what information they wanted to include on the poster, and drafted it out on Illustrator without color before showing them. I asked them if there was information I could cut back and any colors that they might want on the poster. From their feedback, I cut back on the number of words in our information and used their color suggestion "blue" to the poster. I then decided to add circles around the information because it gave it a more dynamic feel. I felt that there was too much blue, so I added a little bit of green to give it a little contrast. As I was working on the poster, I was doing a survey for another class, and wished I had a QR code that people could scan and take the survey instead of having to type in the URL. So, I added the QR code to the sign up form on the poster to make it easy for those who are interested to join!
