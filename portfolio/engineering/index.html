    <h3>"Wobbler" Steam Engine Overview</h3>
      <p>The Wobbler Steam Engine is a simple steam-engine design that was used in the past as to run ships and other engines. Even though the design is no longer in use on the large scale, it's fascinating to see how it works. The design that we made, inspired by a design on Mr. Pete's YouTube channel, is run with compressed air, instead of steam. 
     <br> We began on September 6, 2017 by looking at videos on the design and how it works, and then started designing it on OnShape, an online Computer Aided Design (CAD) application. The engine consists of 7 main parts: a wood base, tower, flywheel, flywheel axel, crank wheel, cylinder head, and piston assembly. For this project, we mainly used the the lathe and the mill. I learned how to use both, the applications of both, and I also got more comfortable with the belt sander and grinder.</p>

    <h3>First G-code Exercise Overview</h3>
      <p>In order to get more familiar with the machines we're using in Engineering, we learned a little bit about the code that these machines use: G-code. We were assigned to create a line, patterned four times. We changed depths and feed speeds in order to also see how those can affect the quality of a piece. To test our codes, we used an online tool (http://chilipeppr.com/tinyg) to simulate what the tool path would look like.</p>

    <h3>First 3D Solid Model Overview</h3>
      <p>This was our first project on the Maverick CNC router. We had to create something that could fit in a 3.5"x3.5"x1.75" box, and be cut with a 0.5" end mill. I decided to make a business card holder. I used Fusion 360 to sketch and create the piece, as well as use Fusion's CAM software to generate the code.</p>

    <h3>Complex Surface Machining Overview</h3>
      <p>This project was to use a 3/16‚Äù ball end mill on the CNC router and create a complex surface. I began by starting my piece in Fusion. Afterwards, used another CAM software to generate the code. </p>

    <h3>Flat Pack Project Overview</h3>
      <p>In this project, we created a 3D object that could be pressed together with multiple 2D pieces. The constraints were that the piece should fit on a 2'x5' board of plywood, and could use either 1/2" or 1/4" thickness. We again used the Maverick Router. My pieces were cut on the 1/4" thick plywood with a 1/8" end mill. </p>

    <h3>Geneva Mechanism Overview</h3>
      <p>For this project, we looked at videos showing how the Geneva Mechanism moves/works. Then we had to design one ourselves and think about how it moves and think about clearances between parts. Larger clearances require less design accuracy but also can cause it not to operate correctly. Having no clearances would not allow it to move. We used the laser cutter to cut the pieces out and test if the clearances worked. I made adjustments, and then we used Fusion 360's CAM software to generate code to cut out the drive wheel. We then cut out the remaining pieces on the water jet, and assembled it.</p>
