	<h2>Quick Overview</h2>
	<p>This was our first project on the Maverick CNC router. We had to create something that could fit in a 3.5"x3.5"x1.75" box, and be cut with a 0.5" end mill. I decided to make a business card holder. I used Fusion 360 to sketch and create the piece, as well as use Fusion's CAM software to generate the code.</p>

<div class="sectioneven">
	<h2>What we did</h2>
		<h3>What I learned...</h3>
			<p>I learned how to use Fusion's CAM software to generate code, and that it's much better to cut out pockets first, and then do the contour on the outside. We also used tabs, which could be added in with the CAM software. When we started cutting my piece, the whole block of wood slipped because it wasn't clamped in a certain direction, and the force in that direction was really strong. I learned that you need to really clamp down objects on all sides when cutting, and sometimes you have to get creative with that. I also learned you have to be careful where you're clamping your pieces so you don't cut into the clamps.</p>
		<h3>Challenges...</h3>
			<p>In order to fit a business card, I had to make the width of the hole greater than three and a half inches. This was only possible of I put it on the diagonal. Also, because the spindle was spinning so quickly, my teacher suggested that I should try to make the width between pockets and the edge at least 1/8" so it wouldn't just get blown off. Also, because we had to work with a certain size bit, it was challenging to cut small details that I would have liked to include, and visually, I would not have liked the inside corners to be so rounded. But because I had these limitations, it made it all the more fun, and unique in its own way.</p>
		<h3>If I were to do it again...</h3>
			<p>I would have liked to cut it out of foam first, or at least have a prototype so that I could go back and edit things if I didn't like the design. It's different to have the solid object in front of you (that you can hold) versus a virtual object on your computer screen. I think some of the walls I made could have been thinner. But overall, I think the restrictions helped me be more creative, and make a more unique piece.</p>
