	<h3>Device and fabrication process</h3>
		<p>The "Wobbler" Steam Engine is a simple steam-engine design that was used in the past as to run ships and other engines. Even though the design is no longer in use on the large scale, it's fascinating to see how it works. The design that we made, inspired by a design on Mr. Pete's YouTube channel, is run with compressed air, instead of steam. 
		<br>We began on September 6, 2017 by looking at videos on the design and how it works, and then started designing it on OnShape, an online Computer Aided Design (CAD) application. The engine consists of 7 main parts: a wood base, tower, flywheel, flywheel axel, crank wheel, cylinder head, and piston assembly. For this project, we mainly used the the lathe and the mill.</p>

	<h3>Personal Experience</h3>
		<p>I began this during the first semester of my Junior year in an engineering class my school offers. This was my first time working with metal, and I learned how to use both the lathe and the mill. I also got more comfortable with the belt sander, grinder, dremel, and other handy tools, like the file and the de-burrer, to remove burs from edges or holes. I also became more comfortable with using OnShape, and learned many cool implications I can use it for.
		<br>For me, the toughest part of the project was the assembly. It required precision for all the parts to work together, and also took patience to let the "Loctite glue" dry before continuing to work on pieces, and not letting the metal heat up too much. I thought it was a really fun project, and a great way to learn how to use many of the tools in the machine shop.
