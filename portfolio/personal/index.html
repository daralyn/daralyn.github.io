    <h4>Here are some other interests/activities I've done.</h4>
    <p><br>This video is what I made for LaunchX, an entrepreneurship club that our school participates in. It walks you through what the idea is, as well as some of the steps we took to seeing the benefits/usage of our product</p>

    <p><br>I enjoy playing music. I started off on the piano when I was three, switched to violin in 4th grade, switched to cello in 6th grade, and also picked up the guitar. I've participated in orchestra at our school, however, in order to have time to take the engineering and design classes, I stopped playing in orchestra. <br> I still take lessons though. Throughout my junior year, I worked Bach Cello Suite No.1 in G. For a recital this summer, I chose three movements to play, and made a nature video to go along with it. This is because the suites remind me of nature and being outdoors. </p>
