    <h1>About Me</h1>
    	<div id="aboutparagrah">
    		<p>I'm currently a Freshman studying Mechanical Engineering at Boston University in Boston, MA. Being in nature and seeing all the complex systems it has excites and inspires me to learn more about the world. In school, some of my favorite classes include Chinese, Engineering, Physics, and Math. Outside of school I enjoy many activities, including photography, Chinese calligraphy, drawing, music and sports.</p>
    		<p>Now that you're on my site, maybe you're also wondering why I made this e-portfolio. During my Junior year of high school, some of my classes wanted me to make portfolios of projects or assignments I'd done in class. So over the summer, between my Junior and Senior year, I decided I wanted to learn about html and CSS to build my own e-portfolio. If you're looking around on here, and there's a broken link, or something missing, please let me know, and I'll do my best to fix it!</p>
