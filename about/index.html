    <h1>About Me</h1>
    	<div id="aboutparagrah">
    		<p>I'm currently a Senior at Punahou School in Honolulu, Hawaii. Being in nature and seeing all the complex systems it has excites and inspires me to learn more about the world. In school, some of my favorite classes include Chinese, Engineering, Physics, and Math. Outside of school I enjoy many activities, including photography, Chinese calligraphy, painting, cello, swimming, and traveling.</p>
    		<p>Now that you're on my site, maybe you're also wondering why I made this e-portfolio. During my Junior year, some of my classes wanted me to make portfolios of projects or assignments I'd done in that class. So over the summer, between my Junior and Senior year, I decided I wanted to learn about html and CSS to build my own e-portfolio. So, I'm pretty new at this. If you're looking around on here, and there's a broken link, or something missing, please let me know, and I'll try my best to fix it!</p>
